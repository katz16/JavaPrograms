Recursion is a function calling itself.
Each time the function will call itself with a simpler version of the original problem.

Types:
// 1. Direct Recursion: A function is called direct recursive if it calls itself.
// 2. Indirect Recursion: Function 1 calls Function 2 and Function 2 calls Function 1.
// 3. Tail Recursion: The recursive call is the last operation in the function.
// 4. Non-Tail Recursion: The recursive call is not the last operation in the function.
